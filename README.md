Sign Language Detector

This projects detects the gestures and identifies them, essentially translating the sign gestures to universal language i.e., English in real-time. This project uses the concept of Object Detection and Classification using TensorFlow. 
For mapping, MediaPipe is used to ensure the mapping of finger tips in order to detect them.
The objective of this project is to build a bridge between a person with hearing/speaking disabilities and a person without such disabilities. As, not everyone knows the sign language which makes it difficult for them to be understood in the outside world.
